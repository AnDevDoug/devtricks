# Developer Tricks samples from AnDevCon

This is a companion sample app from my talk at [AnDevCon](http://www.andevcon.com/) titled
"Android Developer Big Bag of Tricks".  It demonstrates some non-obvious development patterns
that can help streamline your dev cycles and make life easier working your apps and SDKs.

You should be able to import the project into Android Studio and build it with the gradle
wrapper on the command line.
